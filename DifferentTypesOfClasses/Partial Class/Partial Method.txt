** partial method are private by default. I cant include any access modifier explicitly.

** partial class or struct can contain partial method, non partial class cant 

** partial method consist of 2 parts
	1. definition 
	2. implementation 

** implementation for partial method is optional, if we dont provide the implementation, the 
compiler removes the signature and calls.

** to include declaration and implementation at the same time for a partial method, it will
compile time error.

** partial method return type must be void.

** partial method can be implemented only once.
